<h2>Stefan Vorkoetter's Virtual Slide Rule:</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left: 2em;">

<a href="Aristo&#32;970&#32;Simulator/index.html">Aristo Multilog Nr. 970</a></h3>

<p>This one is complete with a <i><b>numeric readout</b></i> of the cursor position! It's really useful if you're 
unfamiliar with reading the various scales. Here is the link to <a href="http://www.stefanv.com/calculators/aristo970/index.html" target="_blank">the original web page</a> for this simulator, as well as <a href="http://www.stefanv.com/calculators/index.html" target="_blank">Stefan's Historical Computing Devices</a>.</p>
<h2>Basic Help</h2>
<p>If you're not sure about how to use a slide rule, take a look at 
<a href="sr-calcs-by-example.html" target=_blank>Slide Rule Calculations by Example</a>.
It's a self-guided demo that demonstrates different calculations by simple examples. Also included is <a href="doc/HowToUse.html" target="_blank">How to Use Your Pickett Slide Rule</a>, a simple 4 page  manual (scanned in 4 images).</p>
<h2>Self-Contained Version</h2>
<p>This package allows you to run Derek's Virtual Slide Rule Gallery self-contained on any computer, without an internet connection. It's perfect for putting on a USB drive. This web page has been edited to make it a bit more modern in appearance, to remove the user comments and external links (except the Aristo 970 one which I have also made part of this package), and text and style changes as appropriate. All of the virtual rule pages have been made identical in style, and they now share a single style sheet and a single copy of the wz-dragdrop script. If you want to see the original page and the stuff that is there, you <i>do</i> need to be connected to the net, then just go to <a href="http://www.antiquark.com/sliderule/sim/index.html" target="_blank">Derek's original site</a>. It should be noted that the virtual slide rules were made possible by <a href="http://www.walterzorn.com/dragdrop/dragdrop_e.htm" target="_blank">Walter Zorn's Drag and Drop for Images and Layers</a>.</p>
<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>These pages should work in modern browsers that support the  JavaScript and W3C DOM standards.	As of January 2009, it should work in your browser unless you are a serious Luddite and haven't updated your browser in many years!</p>
