</h2>
This isn't really a tutorial, it's more of a self-guided demo. This
page gives numeric examples of the basic calculations that a slide
rule can do. Just follow the step-by-step instructions and you will be
amazed by the power and versatility of the venerable slipstick. Just
start up a <a

  <li> The cursor is at 5.45 on the C scale. </li>
  <li> We know that the correct answer for a sin in this range is

</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId270328"></a>
Cos(x) for angles between 5.7&deg; and 90&deg; (uses S and C scales)</h2>
Example: calculate cos(33&deg;). <br>
<ul>
  <li> The cos scale shares the sin S scale. Instead of increasing
from left to right like the sin scale, cos increases from right to
left. This is indicated on the slide rule by '&lt;' characters which
remind you that the number in increasing 'backwards'. </li>
  <li> Move the cursor to &lt;33 on the S scale. </li>
  <li> The cursor is now at 8.4 on the C scale. </li>

increases from right to left, as indicated by the '&lt;' before the
numbers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at &lt;1.96 on the CI scale.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId520478"></a>Tan(x) for
angles between between 45&deg; and 84&deg; (uses forward T and C scale)
</h2>
Example: calculate tan(63&deg;).
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 63 on the forward T scale. This scale
increases from left to right.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 1.96 on the C scale.</li>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId337320"></a>Sin(x) and tan(x) for
angles between 0.6&deg; and 5.7&deg;&nbsp;
(using the ST and C scales)</h2>
In this range, the sin and tan functions are very close in value, so a
single scale can be used to calculate both.<br>
<br>
Example: calculate sin(1.5&deg;)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.5 on the ST scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 2.62 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer for a sin in this range is
between 0.01 and 0.1, so we adjust the decimal place to get 0.0262.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId646264"></a>Sin(x) and
tan(x) for other small angles (using C and D scales)</h2>
For small angles, the sin or tan function can be approximated closely
by the equation: <br>
sin(x) = tan(x) = x / (180/&#960;)&nbsp; =&nbsp; x / 57.3.<br>
Knowing this, the calculation becomes a simple division. This technique
can also be used on rules without an ST scale.<br>
<br>
Example: calculate sin(0.3&deg;)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 3 on the D scale.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Slide 5.73 on the C scale to the cursor. Most rules have a tick
labeled 'R' at this point.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Move the cursor to either the leftmost or rightmost '1' on the C
scale, whichever is in range.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 5.24 on the D scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer is near 0.3 / 60 = 0.005, so we
adjust the decimal place to get 0.00524.</li>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId517550"></a>Square (uses C and B

Example: calculate 4.7<sup> 2 </sup><br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 4.7 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 2.2 on the B scale.</li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer is near 5<sup>2</sup> = 25, so we
adjust the decimal place to get 22.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId178634"></a>Square Root (uses C
and B scales)</h2>
Example: calculate &#8730;4500<br>
<ul>
  <li>You will notice that the B scale has two similar halves. The
first step is to decide which half to use to find a square root.</li>
  <li>The left half is used to find the square root of numbers with odd
numbers of digits or leading zeros after the decimal point. The right
half is used for numbers with even numbers of digits or leading zeros.
Since 4500 has an even number of digits, then we'll use the right half
of the scale.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 4.5 on the right half of the B scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 6.7 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>We know that 70<sup>2</sup> = 3600, which is in the ballpark of
4500. Therefore we adjust the decimal point to get a result of 67.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId648550"></a>Cubes and Cube Roots</h1>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId924903"></a>Cube&nbsp; (uses D
and K scales)</h2>
Example: calculate 4.7<sup>3</sup> <br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 4.7 on the D scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 1.04 on the K scale.</li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer is near 5 x 5 x 5, which, to
further approximate, is near 5 x 5 x 4 = 5 x 20 = 100. Therefore we
adjust the decimal point to get a result of 104.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId734623"></a>Cube Root (uses D and
K scales)</h2>
Example: calculate <sup>3</sup>&#8730;4500 <br>
<ul>
  <li>You will notice that the K scale has three similar thirds. The
first step is to determine which third to use to find the cube root.</li>
  <li>The first third is used to find the cube root is numbers with one
digit. You can cycle through the thirds, increasing the number of
digits by one
for each third, to find which part to use.</li>
  <li>For the value of 4500, which has 4 digits, we cycle through the
thirds and find that we would use the first third.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 4.5 on the third third of the K scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 1.65 on the D scale.</li>
  <li>We can take a guess that the correct answer is around 10. The
cube of 10 is 1000 and the cube of 20 is 8000. Thus we know that the
correct answer is between 10 and 20, therefore we can move the decimal
place and get the correct result of 16.5.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId709189"></a>Log-Log Scales</h1>
Log-log scales are used to raise numbers to powers. Unlike many of the
other scales, log-log scales can't be learned simply be memorizing a
few
rules. It is necessary to actually understand how they work. These
examples are intended to gradually introduce you to the concepts of
log-log scales, so you gain that understanding. Hopefully, the power of
10 examples don't bore you, as they lay the foundation for later
examples. <br>
<br>
Since there are many slight variations of log-log scales on different
slide rules, I'll refer only to the scales found on the Pickett N3,
Pickett N600 and Pickett N803 slide rules (among others). If you want
to view a virtual N3, click <a target="_blank"
 href="n3t/virtual-n3-t.html">here</a>,

(opens in a new window.)<br>
<br>
Another interesting aspect of&nbsp; LL scales is that the decimal point
is "placed." That is, you don't have to figure out afterwards where the
decimal point belongs in your result. The disadvantage to this is that
LL scales are limited in the numbers they can calculate. Typically, the
highest result you can get is about 20,000, and the lowest is 1/20,000
or 0.00005. One exception to this is the Picket N4 (virtual <a
 target="_blank"
 href="n4es/virtual-n4es.html">here</a>),
which goes up to 10<sup>10</sup>.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId916253"></a>Raising a Number to
Powers of 10 (N&gt;1)</h2>
To raise a number to the power of 10, simply move the cursor to the
number and look at the next highest LL scale. (These examples are for
numbers greater than 1. )<br>
<br>
Example: calculate 1.35 <sup>10</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (uses LL2
and
LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.35 on the LL2 scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is at 20.1 on the LL3 scale. This is the correct
answer. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 1.04 <sup>100</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (uses LL1
and
LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.04 on the LL1 scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cursor is at 50.5 on the LL3 scale.</li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 1.002 <sup>1000</sup>&nbsp; (uses LL0 and LL3
scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.002 on the LL0 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is at 7.4 on the LL3 scale. This is the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
Example: calculate sequential powers of ten of 1.002 (uses LL0 to LL3
scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.002 on the LL0 scale.</li>
  <li>On LL1, the cursor is at 1.002 <sup>10</sup> , or 1.02.</li>
  <li>On LL2, the cursor is at 1.002 <sup>100</sup> , or 1.22.</li>
  <li>On LL3, the cursor is at 1.002 <sup>1000</sup> , or 7.4.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId702509"></a>Raising a Number to
Powers of 10 (N&lt;1)</h2>
The reciprocals of the LL scales are the -LL scales. They work the same
way, but you have to make sure that you look for the answer on a -LL
scale. <br>
<br>
Example: calculate 0.75 <sup>10</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (uses
-LL2
and -LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 0.75 on the -LL2 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is at 0.056 on the -LL3 scale. This is the correct
answer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId176241"></a>Finding the 10th Root</h2>
As you've seen in the previous examples, to raise a number to the 10th
power, you simply look at the adjacent number on the next highest LL
scale. To find a tenth root, you look at the adjacent number on the
next lowest LL scale. Remember also that finding the tenth root is the
same as raising a number to the power of 0.1. <br>
<br>
Example: calculate <sup>10</sup>&#8730;5, or 5 <sup>0.1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(uses LL2 and LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 5 on the LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 1.175 on the LL2 scale. This is the correct
answer.</li>
</ul>
Example: calculate <sup>100</sup>&#8730;0.15, or 0.15 <sup>0.01</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(uses -LL3 and -LL1 scale)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 0.15 on the -LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 0.9812 on the -LL1 scale. This is the
correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId676447"></a>Arbitrary Powers
(Staying on Same LL Scale)</h2>
Occasionally, depending on the numbers, it is possible to calculate a
power without switching scales. <br>
<br>
Example: calculate 9.1 <sup>2.3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; (uses LL3 scale)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Move the cursor to 9.1 on the LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the leftmost '1' on C to the cursor.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 2.3 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at about 160 on the LL3. This is very close to
the correct answer of 160.6. One of the problems with LL scales is that
their accuracy diminishes as the numbers increase in value. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 230 <sup>0.45</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (uses
LL3 scale)<br>
<ul>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId398379"></a>Arbitrary Powers
(Switching LL Scales)</h2>
One of the rules of exponents is that (A <sup>B</sup> ) <sup>C</sup>
is equal to A <sup>B x C</sup>. We can use this fact, along with our
knowledge of powers of ten, to calculate arbitrary powers.<br>
<br>
Example: calculate 1.9 <sup>2.5 </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
(uses LL2 and LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>If we try to calculate this the easy way, the power 2.5 is out of
range for the scale.</li>
  <li>We can reinterpret the problem as:<br>
Calculate (1.9 <sup>0.25</sup> ) <sup>10</sup><br>
Because 0.25 x 10 is 2.5.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.9 on the LL2 scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the rightmost '1' on the C scale to the cursor.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 2.5 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 1.9 <sup>0.25</sup> on the LL2 scale. Since
we want to also raise this to the power of 10, we look "one scale
higher" at the LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is at 4.97 on the LL3 scale. This is the correct
answer.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 12 <sup>0.34</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (uses
LL3 and LL2 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Like the previous example, if we try to calculate this the easy
way, the power 0.34 is out of range for the scale.</li>
  <li>We can reinterpret the problem as:<br>
Calculate (12 <sup>3.4</sup> ) <sup>0.1</sup><br>
Because 3.4 x 0.1 is 0.34.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 12 on the LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the leftmost '1' on the C scale to the cursor.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 3.4 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 12 <sup>3.4</sup> on the LL3 scale, which
is about 5000 (which is not the number we're looking for). Since we
also want to raise this to the power of 0.1, we look at the LL2 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 2.33 on the LL2 scale. This is the correct
answer. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 0.99 <sup>560</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; (uses -LL1 and
-LL3 scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>We can reinterpret this problem as:<br>
Calculate (0.99 <sup>5.6</sup> ) <sup>100</sup><br>
Because 5.6 x 100 = 560</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 0.99 on the -LL1 scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the leftmost '1' on the C scale to the cursor.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 5.6 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 0.99 <sup>5.6</sup> on the -LL1 scale.
Since we also want to raise this to the power of 100, we look "two
scales higher", or the -LL3 scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 0.0036 on the -LL3 scale. This is the
correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId364108"></a>Log-Log Approximations</h2>
In general, LL scales don't handle numbers extremely close to 1, such
as 1.001 or 0.999. This is not a problem because there is an accurate
approximation for numbers in this range. In general, if you have a very
small number 'd', then:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 + d) <sup>p</sup> = 1 + d p<br>
<br>
Example: calculate 1.00012 <sup>34</sup> &nbsp; (uses C and D scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, if we use the approximation (1 + d) <sup>p</sup> =
1 + d p, then:<br>
d = 0.00012, and <br>
p = 34</li>
  <li>We must calculate 0.00012 * 34.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 1.2 on the D scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the leftmost '1' on the C scale to the cursor. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 3.4 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is now at 4.08 on the D scale. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer would be near 0.0001 * 30, or
0.003. Therefore we adjust the decimal point to get a value of 0.00408.</li>
  <li>Add 1 to 0.00408. The result is 1.00408, which is very close to
the correct answer of 1.004088.</li>
</ul>
Example: calculate 0.99943 <sup>21</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; (uses C and D
scales)<br>
<ul>
  <li>Like before, we'll use the approximation (1 + d) <sup>p</sup> =
1 + d p. In this case:<br>
d = (0.99943 - 1) = -0.00057, and <br>
p = 21</li>
  <li>We must calculate -0.00057 * 21.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 5.7 on the D scale.</li>
  <li>Slide the rightmost '1' on the C scale to the cursor.</li>
  <li>Move the cursor to 2.1 on the C scale.</li>
  <li>The cursor is at 1.195 on the D scale.</li>
  <li>We know that the correct answer would be near -0.0006 * 20, or
-0.0120. Therefore we adjust the decimal point to get a value of
-0.01195. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Subtract 0.01195 from 1. The result is (1 - 0.01195) = 0.98803.
This is very close to the correct answer of 0.98809.<br>
  </li>
